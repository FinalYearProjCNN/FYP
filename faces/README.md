# FYP - Final Year Project University of Limerick
Facial feature recognition is a rapidly developing field that has the potential to transform the way mental health illness is diagnosed and treated. 
By analysing facial features, such as expressions and emotional states, 
it is possible to gain insight into an individual's mental health and identify potential issues that may need to be addressed in treatment.
The project explores some of the promising technologies and techniques that are being developed to improve the accuracy and reliability of facial feature recognition for mental health diagnosis. 
The application of an assistive diagnosis tool in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed and discussed as the final product of the project.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that is commonly used for image classification and object recognition tasks
